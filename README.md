Welcome to my CSS snippets repository!
 
 # <h3>Introduction</h3>
Welcome to the "CSS Snippets" repository, a collection of my personally crafted CSS snippets designed to add captivating visual elements and functionality 
to the web projects. This repository showcases a variety of design-focused CSS snippets, including parallax effects, landing page styles, navigation bars, buttons,
and much more.

Each design comes with a separate video showcase to give you a glimpse of how it looks and behaves in action. You'll find the video within each folder,
allowing you to checkout how the design looks like.

# <h3>Features</h3>
Here, I've designed a range of CSS snippets for various design purposes, including but not limited to:

- Stunning gradient buttons
- Eye-catching landing pages
- Mesmerizing parallax effects
- Sleek and stylish navigation bars
<br>
and much more will be updated soon.
